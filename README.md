## Nuxt
We use [Nuxt](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js) as a base framework. For detailed explanation on how Nuxt works, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org/guide).


## Linting
We're using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to lint our code.

### Running linter
```bash
yarn test:lint
```

## Unit Testing
We're using [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) to write unit and integration tests for our components. 

### Running Tests
To run the unit tests you can run:

```bash
yarn test:unit
```

### Integration Tests
Each file inside the `/test/unit` folder will be loaded as a test by the Jest test runner. Have a look at the [docs](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs) for more information.
